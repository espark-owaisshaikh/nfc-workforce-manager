You will be prompted to enter the `SUPER_ADMIN_CREATION_SECRET` defined in your `.env`.

This user will have access to all modules including:
- Admins
- Company Profile
- Departments
- Employees

## 🤝 Frontend Integration Notes

- Send the **JWT token** in the `Authorization` header:
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```
- Company profile must be created before accessing any module.
- Refer to Swagger for all request/response formats.
- Respect role-based access logic:
  - Admins have limited access
  - Super Admin has full access
